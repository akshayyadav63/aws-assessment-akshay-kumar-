Create an internet-facing Application Load Balancer in public subnets, create a Launch Template (with same user_data as Task 2 to install Nginx and serve the resume), and an Auto Scaling Group spanning two AZs (private subnets) attached to the ALB target group. Use private subnets for instances and put ALB in public subnets so traffic flows: Internet → ALB → Target Group → EC2 in private subnets. Health checks configured on /.
