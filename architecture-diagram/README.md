Design an internet-facing ALB in public subnets to accept traffic and forward to an Auto Scaling Group of web servers in private subnets across multiple AZs. Use an RDS (Aurora or RDS MySQL) in its own private subnets with Multi-AZ for failover. Add ElastiCache (Redis) in private subnets for caching. Use Security Groups to control access and NACLs for subnet-level rules. Add WAF in front of ALB for protection against OWASP vulnerabilities. Observability is via CloudWatch metrics, logs aggregated to CloudWatch Logs, and alarms for errors and billing.
